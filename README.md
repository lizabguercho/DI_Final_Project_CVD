# 🫀 Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

Data Analytics | Machine Learning | Healthcare

This project aims to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using a Kaggle dataset of ~70,000 patients.
It includes full data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, machine-learning models, and an interactive Tableau dashboard.

## 🔧 Workflow Summary
### 1. Data Cleaning

• Removed unrealistic values

• Corrected swapped BP values

• Created new features: BMI, pulse pressure, BP categories, metabolic syndrome flags

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

• Risk factors: age, BP, cholesterol, BMI

• Correlation heatmaps & stratified insights

• Visualizations built in Tableau

### 3. Machine Learning

Models tested:

• Logistic Regression

• Random Forest

• Gradient Boosted Tree (Best performance)

Metrics show Gradient Boosted Tree achieved the strongest balance between precision, recall, and accuracy.

## 🧠 Key Insights

• High blood pressure, age, cholesterol, and BMI strongly influence CVD risk.

• Combining multiple risk factors significantly increases predicted probability.

• Feature-engineered variables improved model performance.High blood pressure, age, cholesterol, and BMI strongly influence CVD risk.

## 🛠️ Tools

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau
